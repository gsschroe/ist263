        Hi my name is Greg Schroeder. I am a Data Analytics major and I am hoping to use my degree in the sports field. I am an Eagle Scout and a Dean's List student. I love exploring, hanging with friends and family, and watching the Mets. My favorite people are my four nephewsâ€¦ I became an uncle when I was 14 :)
